# vacation weather api
Using citipy (https://github.com/wingchen/citipy) this project was able to create a random array of coordinates that enabled us to choose the nearest city using citipy. From there this project plotted various weather based metrics to determine if latitude was of any significance. From there we were able to narrow down options based on bad weather, locate various hotels and recommend the best vacation spots!
