# vacation weather api
Using citipy (https://github.com/wingchen/citipy) this project was able to create a random array of coordinates that triggered citipy to choose the nearest city. From there data cleaning occured with pandas while matplotlib handled ploting the various metrics. Finally creating a list of nearby hotels with google apis and plotting them using gmaps led to the best vaction destinations globally!
Please open a jupyter notebook to scroll through each .ipynb file. The final file, Vacation.ipynb, has the recommended city with a recommended hotel.
